# Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project was developed during my Machine Learning Internship at **Verzeo** (June to July 2022). The objective was to analyze the Titanic passenger dataset and build a predictive model that determines the likelihood of passenger survival based on demographic and socio-economic features.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Titanic survival prediction problem is a classic **binary classification** task. The dataset contains information such as age, gender, passenger class, and family details. Using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms, this project attempts to identify key factors that influenced survival.

## 📊 Results & Observations

After training and testing multiple models, the **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the best performance in terms of accuracy and generalization. EDA also showed that:

- Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates
- Passengers in **1st class** survived more frequently
- Children had better survival chances compared to adults
